# Early islamic battles interactive map
This work explores how the data visualization tools can help history teachers to build their narratives and involve students in academic research. The work is a web-based data visualization system which allows users to explore Islamic history through battles. It consists of map, timeline and data management system. It allows to input data about Islamic battles and visualizes that data. Additionally, users are able to explore the battles, considering their temporal, spatial and geographical contexts. It was developed in collaboration with a research fellow and active lecturer in Historical Studies.
